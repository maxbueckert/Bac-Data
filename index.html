                        <p>This website we provides growth conditions for over 50 different bacteria species commonly used in 
                            research. Our database is continuously expanding, so if the bacteria you are
                             looking for is not included yet, we apologize in advance. <br>

                            Please note that, as a researcher, it's important to double check and consult peer-reviewed literature before 
                            planning experiments based on the information provided by this website. We strive to provide 
                            accurate and reliable information, but it's always good practice to verify the information with other sources. <br>
                            
                            If you're interested in the types of bacteria included in our database, 
                            please click on the link provided below for more information. With our database,
                             we aim to assist researchers in their work and make it easier to find 
                             the growth conditions for the bacteria they need. </p>
